Network has brought convenience to the world by allowing flexible
transformation of data, but it also exposes a high number of vulnerabilities. A
Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) helps system and network
administrators to detect network security breaches in their organizations.
Identifying anonymous and new attacks is one of the main challenges in IDSs
researches. Machine learning methodologies have been widely used in
identifying various types of attacks, and a machine learning approach can help
the network administrator take the corresponding measures for preventing
intrusions. However, most of the traditional machine learning methodologies
belong to shallow learning and often emphasize feature engineering and selection.
They cannot effectively solve the massive intrusion data classification problem
that arises in the face of a real network application environment.
Machine Learning is a vast field and comprises of number of algorithms which
can perform supervised as well as unsupervised tasks. For Network Intrusion
Detection, we have used a few of the Supervised Algorithms to detect anomaly
in the network activity. These algorithms will predict the occurrence of a potential
attack with a certain probability and will thus help the network administrator
prepare well.
